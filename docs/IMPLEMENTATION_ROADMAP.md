# Tower Climb - Implementation Roadmap

## Development Philosophy
Following CAFE v5.1-ACG principles:
1. **Contract-First**: Define behavior before coding
2. **Test-Driven**: Tests validate contracts
3. **Incremental**: Ship working features early
4. **Simple First**: Complexity only when needed

## Daily Workflow

### Morning Routine (2-3 hours)
1. Review previous session
2. Write contracts for day's features
3. Implement with TDD
4. Validate with UTF tests

### Afternoon Routine (2-3 hours)
1. Integration work
2. Polish and feel
3. Playtesting
4. Document learnings

### End of Day
1. Commit all changes
2. Update progress tracking
3. Note blockers for next day
4. Quick playtest of build

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Performance**: Profile early, optimize only bottlenecks
- **Complexity**: Refuse scope creep, MVP first
- **Bugs**: Comprehensive testing, fail fast

### Design Risks  
- **Not fun**: Playtest daily, adjust quickly
- **Too hard**: Err on easier side for MVP
- **Confusing**: Clear visual feedback

### Schedule Risks
- **Behind schedule**: Cut features, not quality
- **Blocked**: Have backup tasks ready
- **Burnout**: Sustainable pace, breaks

---

## Definition of Done (per Contract)
- [ ] Contract written and reviewed
- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] UTF tests passing
- [ ] Coverage â‰¥90%
- [ ] Integration tested
- [ ] No critical bugs
- [ ] Documented as needed

## MVP Exit Criteria
- [ ] All Phase 0-3 contracts complete
- [ ] Game loop is fun
- [ ] No critical bugs
- [ ] Performance acceptable (60 FPS)
- [ ] Packaged for distribution
- [ ] Basic documentation complete

---

## Post-MVP Planning
Only after MVP ships:
1. Gather feedback (1 week)
2. Plan Phase 4 features
3. Consider platform expansion
4. Evaluate advanced features

Remember: **Simple and shipped beats complex and stuck!**
