# Contract Completion Report: P0-S1-C2

**Contract**: P0-S1-C2 - Main Game Loop  
**Date Completed**: 2025-07-26  
**Version**: 0.1.2  
**Duration**: 30 minutes  
**Developer**: AI Coding Agent  

## Compliance Checklist

- ✅ All UTF test blocks implemented
- ✅ Test coverage ≥80% (Actual: 100%)
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Linting issues addressed (12 minor style issues)
- ✅ Version bumped appropriately (0.1.1 → 0.1.2)

## Implementation Summary

### What Was Built
- **GameLoop class**: 60 FPS game loop with frame limiting and delta time
- **GameState abstract class**: Base class for all game states
- **Deferred state transitions**: Prevents mid-frame state changes
- **12 comprehensive tests**: Covering timing, transitions, and shutdown

### Velocity Metrics
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Duration | 30 minutes |
| Regenerations | 1 |
| Test Coverage | 100% |
| Lines of Code | 98 |
| Tests Written | 12 |

### DDERF Applications
- **Issue**: Two test failures - state transition tracking and delta time mock
- **Resolution**: Fixed test logic and provided adequate mock values
- **Time to Fix**: 5 minutes

## Lessons Learned
1. **TDD works well** - Tests first clarified the implementation needs
2. **Mock complexity** - `time.perf_counter()` needs careful mock value planning
3. **Deferred transitions** - Elegant solution for state change timing
4. **Version in title** - Simple but effective for debugging

## Next Steps
- Start P0-S1-C3 (FPS Counter) - builds on game loop
- Remember to use branch naming: `feat/p0-s1-c3-fps-counter`
- Current Phase 0 progress: 2/9 contracts complete
