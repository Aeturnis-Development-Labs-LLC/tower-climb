# CLAUDE.md - Tower Climb Project Instructions

This file provides guidance to Claude (AI coding assistant) when working with the Tower Climb project.

## Project Overview
Tower Climb is a roguelike tower climbing game built using CAFE v5.1-ACG methodology. The project emphasizes simplicity, testability, and AI-human collaboration.

## Development Philosophy

### The Three Questions (Always Apply)
1. **"Do we need this now?"** - Avoid premature features
2. **"Is this the simplest way?"** - Start simple, iterate
3. **"What would have helped?"** - Learn from issues

### Key Principles
- **Contract-First**: Define behavior before implementation
- **Test-Driven**: Write tests alongside contracts
- **Simplicity**: Avoid over-engineering
- **Pragmatic Quality**: 90%+ coverage, not perfection

## Project Structure
```
tower-climb/
├── contracts/          # UTF behavioral contracts
├── src/tower_climb/    # Game source code
├── tests/              # Test suite
├── docs/               # Documentation
└── scripts/            # Development tools
```

## Current Phase
**Phase 0**: Project Setup and Core Systems

## Lessons from ASCENT Project
1. **Start Simple**: Single platform first (Windows/Linux)
2. **Avoid CI/CD Complexity**: Local development focus initially
3. **Pragmatic Testing**: 90% coverage is sufficient
4. **Quick Iterations**: Playable game before perfect infrastructure

## Code Standards
- Python 3.11+
- Type hints on all functions
- Docstrings for public APIs
- Black formatting
- 90%+ test coverage

## AI Coding Guidelines
1. **Always include license header**: `# AI-Generated by CAFE v5.1-ACG - MIT License`
2. **Follow existing patterns** in the codebase
3. **Write tests first** when implementing contracts
4. **Keep it simple** - no premature abstractions
5. **Document decisions** in code comments when non-obvious

## Quality Gates
- Tests pass: `pytest`
- Coverage ≥90%: `pytest --cov`
- Type check: `mypy src`
- Format: `black src tests`
- Lint: `flake8 src tests`

## Session Management
When starting a new session:
1. Ask about current phase/goals
2. Review recent changes
3. Check for blockers
4. Continue from last checkpoint

## Remember
- This is a learning project for CAFE methodology
- Simplicity beats complexity every time
- Working game > perfect architecture
- Have fun building!
