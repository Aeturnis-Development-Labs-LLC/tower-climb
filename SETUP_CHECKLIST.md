# Tower Climb Setup Checklist

## ‚úÖ Completed Setup

1. **Project Structure**
   - [x] Basic directory structure (src, tests, docs, contracts, scripts)
   - [x] Python package configuration (pyproject.toml)
   - [x] Entry point module (`__main__.py`)

2. **Version Control**
   - [x] Git repository initialized
   - [x] .gitignore configured
   - [x] .gitattributes for line endings
   - [x] GitHub repository connected

3. **Development Tools**
   - [x] Makefile with common commands
   - [x] Setup script (setup_dev.py)
   - [x] Pre-commit hooks configuration (optional)

4. **CI/CD**
   - [x] GitHub Actions workflow (ci.yml)
   - [x] Release workflow (release.yml)
   - [x] Windows-focused, pragmatic approach

5. **Documentation**
   - [x] README.md with project overview
   - [x] DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md for onboarding
   - [x] GAME_DESIGN.md with phases and features
   - [x] TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md with ECS-lite design
   - [x] VISUAL_DESIGN.md with programmatic shapes
   - [x] CI_CD_STRATEGY.md with lessons from ASCENT

6. **CAFE Methodology**
   - [x] Cafe-velocity tracker integration
   - [x] Continuous session support
   - [x] Velocity reporting scripts
   - [ ] UTF contracts (P#-S#-C# format) - **PENDING**

7. **Quality Tools**
   - [x] pytest for testing
   - [x] black for formatting
   - [x] flake8 for linting
   - [x] mypy for type checking
   - [x] coverage reporting

8. **Game-Specific**
   - [x] Character design decided (minimalist style)
   - [x] Pygame dependency configured
   - [x] Windows platform focus

## üî≤ Next Steps

1. **Create Initial Contracts**
   - [ ] Phase 0 contracts (P0-S1-C1 through P0-S3-C3)
   - [ ] Use cafe-velocity format
   - [ ] Include UTF test blocks

2. **Implement Core Systems**
   - [ ] Basic game loop
   - [ ] ECS-lite framework
   - [ ] Rendering system

3. **Start Development**
   - [ ] Follow CAFE v5.1-ACG methodology
   - [ ] Track progress with velocity tracker
   - [ ] Maintain 90%+ test coverage

## üìù Notes

- All core infrastructure is ready
- Focus is on Windows platform initially
- Using programmatic shapes (no external assets)
- Minimalist character design chosen
- Continuous velocity tracking enabled

The project is ready for contract creation and implementation!
