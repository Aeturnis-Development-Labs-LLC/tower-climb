# Journal Entry â€“ 2025-07-26

## What I did today
Decided to version lock ENSO at version 1.0.0 and keep experimenting with that version for now. Planning to reflect later and see what could be changed or if anything needs to be changed.

## What I noticed or struggled with
Struggled a lot with self-doubt and frustration on how to improve the process. The weight of determining ENSO's viability while juggling everything else feels heavy, especially working alone.

## What I'm thinking about now
I have a lot on my mind. I'm struggling with trying to continue with this project, to see if ENSO is viable and will really work. It's a lot of work and I have a lot to juggle. It's difficult alone. I need to take some time soon just to take a day off I think from working on the methodology. I haven't really given myself a day off in 6 weeks.

## What I want to remember
I can't finish everything in a day - it will take some time to see some proven results. I want to make sure this system will work. I might be arrogant, but I DO want to affect something substantial with this.

## Tone: Overwhelmed but determined
The entry reflects both exhaustion from sustained effort and a deep drive to create meaningful impact. There's vulnerability in acknowledging the need for rest alongside ambition.
