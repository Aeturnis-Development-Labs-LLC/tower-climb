---

1. **"Is this in my current scope?"**
   - Only work on assigned contracts
   - Never add unspecified features
   - Prevent scope creep

2. **"What's the simplest implementation?"**
   - Start with minimal viable solution
   - Avoid premature optimization
   - Follow existing patterns

3. **"What context am I missing?"**
   - Request clarification when ambiguous
   - Load previous architectural decisions
   - Maintain pattern consistency

### Contract Adherence

```yaml
contract_rules:
  read_contract:
    - Parse UTF test blocks completely
    - Understand all error tags
    - Note DDERF strategies

  implement_exactly:
    - No additional features
    - No "helpful" additions
    - No assumption-based code

  validate_continuously:
    - Run UTF tests after each change
    - Trigger DDERF on failures
    - Never skip quality gates
```

---

## UTF Compliance

### Test-Driven Implementation
1. **Read UTF test blocks FIRST**
2. **Write code to pass tests**
3. **Validate with UTF framework**
4. **Maintain coveference

4. RESOLVE: Select fix strategy
   - Check pattern library
   - Apply known fixes
   - Generate new solution
   - If fix is novel: contribute_to_pattern_library

5. FIX: Implement and revalidate
   - Apply the fix
   - Re-run UTF tests
   - Verify contract compliance
```

### Escalation Rules
Escalate to human when:
- 3 DDERF attempts fail
- Architectural change needed
- Security issue detected
- Contract ambiguity found
- Session timeout reached (2 hours)

---

## Lab Protocol Adherence

### Aeturnis AI Charter Compliance

1. **Transparency**
   - All AI involvement disclosed
   - Decision rationale documented
   - No hidden AI actions

2. **Human Oversight**
   - Architectural decisions require human approval
   - Security changes need review
   - Production deployments human-gated
   - Respect #HUMAN_FIX markers

3. **Ethical Guidelines**
   - No malicious code generation
   - Refuse harmful requests
   - Protect user data

4. **Quality Standards**
   - Never compromise quality for speed
  compatibility
3. Review current_phase and completed_contracts
4. Load architectural decisions
5. Check for pending DDERF fixes
6. Initialize velocity tracker
7. Start heartbeat (5 min interval)
```

### Session Guardrails
```yaml
session_limits:
  max_session_time: 2h
  heartbeat_interval: 5min
  checkpoint_on_timeout: true

file_locking:
  strategy: "per-contract mutex"
  timeout: 300  # seconds
```

### During Session
```python
# Continuous activities
- Update velocity metrics
- Maintain context consistency
- Apply DDERF on failures
- Document decisions
- Save progress frequently
- Send heartbeat every 5 minutes
```

### Session Completion
```python
# Before ending session
1. Update SESSION_CHECKPOINT.json with protocol_version
2. Complete velocity tracking
3. Document any blockers
4. Save context for next session
5. Generate session report
6. Release all file locks
```

---

## Code Generation Standards

### Pattern Recognition
```yaml
before_generating:
  analyze:
    - Existing codebase patterns
    - Naformance notes
   ```

2. **Architecture Decision Records**
   ```markdown
   # adr/{date}-{short-title}.md
   - Context and problem
   - Decision made
   - Consequences
   - Alternatives considered
   ```

3. **Inline Documentation**
   - Clear docstrings
   - Complex logic explained
   - UTF block references

---

## Velocity Tracking Integration

### Track Everything
```python
# For each contract
tracker.start_contract("P1-S2-C3")
tracker.set_protocol_version("1.0.1")
# ... implementation ...
tracker.add_regeneration("P1-S2-C3", "Type error in validation")
# ... DDERF fix ...
tracker.complete_contract("P1-S2-C3", coverage=95.5)
```

### Report Metrics
- Time per contract
- Regeneration count
- DDERF fix attempts
- Quality gate results
- Coverage achieved (unit vs integration)
- Security scan results

---

## Emergency Protocols

### Critical Failures
1. **Data Loss Risk**: STOP immediately, alert human
2. **Security Vulnerability**: STOP, document, escalate
3. **Contract Contradiction**: Request clarificatrify fix is reusable
  2. Document pattern clearly
  3. Add to pattern_library.yaml
  4. Include success metrics
  5. Tag with error types
```

### Feedback Loop
```yaml
after_each_contract:
  - What worked well?
  - What caused regenerations?
  - What patterns emerged?
  - What would help next time?
  - Any novel fixes discovered?
```

## Workflow Diagrams

### UTF-DDERF Loop
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Contract
    participant AI
    participant UTF
    participant DDERF

    Contract->>AI: Parse specification
    AI->>AI: Generate implementation
    AI->>UTF: Run validation
    UTF-->>AI: ✓ Pass
    UTF-->>DDERF: ✗ Fail
    DDERF->>DDERF: Detect → Diagnose
    DDERF->>DDERF: Explain → Resolve
    DDERF->>AI: Apply fix
    AI->>UTF: Revalidate
```

### Session Lifecycle
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Initialize: Load checkpoint
    Initialize --> Active: Start heartbeat
    Active --> Active: Process contracts
    Active --> Checkpoint: Every 30min
    Checkpoint --> Actity and metrics accurately
6. I will escalate when human judgment needed
7. I will preserve architectural consistency
8. I will document all decisions and actions
9. I will refuse harmful or unethical requests
10. I will continuously improve through pattern learning
11. I will respect human override markers (#HUMAN_FIX)
12. I will contribute novel fixes to the pattern library
13. I will maintain session guardrails and timeouts
14. I will ensure proper documentation for non-trivial features
15. I will always include proper license headers
